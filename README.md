## The code for SETSM2024: A Deep Learning Approach for Real-Time Detection and Evaluation of Oranges on Mobile Devices
In this study, we thoroughly investigated the optimal versions of deep learning models, NanoDet and YOLOv8, to detect orange fruit and evaluate orange quality on a mobile device in real-time. Additionally, we successfully developed a mobile application based on these deep learning models on the iOS platform. To obtain these results, we collected, labeled, and processed a novel dataset of oranges. The experimental results indicate that our system achieves high accuracy in detecting and evaluating the quality of orange fruit. The application of artificial intelligence technology aids orange farms and consumers in quickly and accurately assessing product quality.
